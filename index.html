        <p class="about_me--para">
          My life is fairly simple until now. I was born in Luzern Switzerland
          on 29th of June and lived in canton Schwyz for 3 years. Then my family
          moved. How much we moved and how long I was there is visible here
          School's ). I am half eastern and half swiss. I can speak fluent
          English since I went to a private school, fluent German and a bit of
          French. I played and tried a lot of sports in my life and when I say a
          lot I mean it. For example: Soccer, Tennis, Basketball, Volleyball,
          Badminton, Gym, Skating, Judo, Golf and more. Some of these I am still
          doing and some others I did for 7 years and more.
        </p>
        <p class="about_me--para">
          Another huge aspect of my life is economy. I love economics and
          everything about it, whether it's stocks, politics, crypto, or making
          a business myself. My dream was always to be a hedge fund manager. But
          as it comes I ended up founding a business myself, which I still
          actively run called Pushmedia (Link to website). I also have
          experience in other work. I worked at the school for 2 weeks in summer
          holidays, in real estate and on the constructions.

              Family is one of the most important things to me. I don't have any
              siblings and am the only child. My father and mother broke up when
              I was 3 years old and I only see him every second week. All my
              grandparents are still alive luckily. In this picture on the right
              you can see my lovely mother, my grandmother, grandfather my uncle
              and his girlfriend.

            I love traveling. I was at many places in my life. Since I have
            family in Chicago I also go to America mostly once a year. I have a
            lot of memories at many places. I am lucky since not many teenagers
            can travel as much as I do. The pictures on the left are some newer
            ones from the this year or last year travels.
